        <h3>PlayStation 5 Pro</h3>
        <p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is finally here, but gamers seem disappointed in it's price.</p>
        <p>To start, the PlayStation 5 Pro offers an upgraded GPU that is supposed to have 67% more Compute Units, and 28% faster memory. The PlayStation 5 Pro should be 45% faster when rendering gameplay. Sony also says they've added 'Advanced Ray Tracing, and AI-Driven Upscaling.</p>
        <p>While it's great that Sony is offering an upgraded PlayStation 5. As Gamers have been begging Nintendo for a 'Swich Pro', many gamers are concerned on it's $700 ($699 w/tax) price. Many are mostly concerned with the fact that the new console doesn't come with a Disc drive, in which the disc drive is sold separately.</p>
        <p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will arrive on Nov 07, 2024.</p>
