        <h3>An unreal new dawn.</h3>
        <p>Xbox Game Studios has created the new Halo Studios & they've also announced that the next Halo game will be made in Unreal Engine 5. The studio's reasoning behind this is that Halo Studios will now be able to focus more on the game than maintaining an engine that will only be use for Halo games.</p> 
        <h3>The why.</h3>
        <p>Microsoft is likely just going to pay for an Unreal Engine license instead of developing an new engine for each Halo game. Ultimately driving down the cost of making a Halo game.</p>
        <h3>What could this mean for Halo fans?</h3>
        <p>This could be a great new era for halo as now Halo Studios can focus on great gameplay and develop new and exciting stories instead of the slop we got in 2021.</p>
        <p>Players on <a herf="https://x.com/Halo/status/1843070142344765942">Twitter</a> are ecstatic for this new era of halo. One player is hoping to <a herf="https://x.com/DunkinDonalds_/status/1843070984624246969">"MAKE HALO MATURE AGAIN".</a></p>
        <p>With how this could go this could bring back Xbox in the console space new generation. If Microsoft doesn't decide to kill of the console devision in the future.</p>
